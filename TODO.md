# TODO
The objective of this theme is to focus on readability and site performance.

## Readability & Design
### Style

### Navigation
- [ ] Refactor navigation bar to use header instead of it's own new line.
  + Remove 'menu' bar, merge three bar nav icon inline with title.
- [ ] Determine the 'correct' media screen sizes when scaling our content.
  + When does the regular navigation become a drop down?

### Posts
- [ ] Add 'pin' icon to sticky notes.
- [ ] Replace 'hearts' with meaningful icon for separating posts.
  + Do we need a separator at all if we are following material design?
- [ ] Determine how we want to display gallery content.
- [ ] Determine how we want to display video content.
- [ ] Determine how we want to display music content.

### Gallery
- [ ] Refactor gallery to better utilize fancybox.

## Performance
### Optimize CSS
- [ ] Test what loads before the fold.
- [ ] Minify CSS.

### Optimize Fonts
